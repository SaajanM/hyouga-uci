# Hyōga UCI
Hyōga (氷河): glacier

## Details
Much like its namesake, development is slow 😃

This is a UCI compatible chess engine written in Rust 🦀

Current plans first involve getting board representation, move generation, and a basic move selector up and running. Currently there exists the barebones of an asynchronous UCI parser.
